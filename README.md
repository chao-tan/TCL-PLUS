## Dataset
We use [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/lucidrains/stylegan2-pytorch) to train and generate typhoon images. 
After screening, we finally collected a simulated dataset called TCLD-AD which contain 20,000 unlabeled typhoon images. 
Our TCLD_AD dataset is available for download at [TianYiCloud(4.5GB)](https://cloud.189.cn/t/EBj6j2jiUNza) or [BaiduCloud(4.5GB)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ukSWG8xqReTBcWQZXdK-yQ) (extraction code: 8a6m).      
You can get the TCLD_AD dataset at any time but only for scientific research. 
At the same time, please cite our work when you use the TCLD_AD dataset.

Our model is highly dependent on [TCLNet](https://github.com/chao-tan/TCLNet). You can implement our model by simply modifying [TCLNet](https://github.com/chao-tan/TCLNet).
